**Pandas Data Science Tasks**

Welcome to the Pandas Data Science Tasks repository! This collection showcases a series of real-world data science projects completed using the powerful Python Pandas library.

**Getting Started**

To access the project files, we recommend following these steps:

1. **Fork and Clone**: Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account. Then, clone the forked repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks.git
   ```

2. **Download ZIP**: Alternatively, you can download the entire repository as a ZIP file. Click the green "Code" button above and select "Download ZIP." After downloading, extract the contents to your desired location.

**Installation**

Before diving into the tasks, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

- **Jupyter Notebook**: If you haven't already, follow the installation guide [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) to set up Jupyter Notebook.
- **Pandas Library**: You'll also need the Pandas library. Install it by following the instructions [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html).

**Project Overview**

1. **Data Cleaning**: We start by cleaning the dataset. Tasks in this phase involve dropping rows with missing values (NaN), filtering data based on specific conditions, and converting column types for accurate analysis.

2. **Data Exploration**: In this phase, we address five high-level business questions:

   - What was the highest-grossing month, and how much revenue was generated?
   - Which city had the highest sales volume?
   - What's the optimal time for displaying advertisements to boost customer purchases?
   - Which products are frequently purchased together?
   - Which individual product achieved the highest sales, and what factors contribute to its success?

**Techniques Used**

Our analysis employs various Pandas and Matplotlib techniques:

- Combining multiple CSV files using `pd.concat` to create a unified DataFrame.
- Creating new columns to enhance analysis.
- Extracting valuable information from cells as strings using `.str` operations.
- Applying custom transformations using the `.apply()` method.
- Utilizing the `groupby` function for aggregating data.
- Visualizing insights with bar charts and line graphs, accompanied by informative labels.

Feel free to explore the projects, adapt the code to your own datasets, and further enhance your Pandas skills while tackling real-world data science challenges!
